# SnellenGlitchActivityApp
Quick and dirty little demo app for my Glitch Art talk at Curiosity Collider's event 2017-06-21.

A volunteer is asked to read the characters from the Snellen chart to determine which line will present errors roughly 10-15% of the time. Then they're asked to read out a predetermined line while the presenter types in the letters that they say. Then the result of the encoding, errors, and decoding is displayed.
